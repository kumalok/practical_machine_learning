## Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. These participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

## Data
1. [Training Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)
2. [Test Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

## Data Preprocessing

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)

trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile=trainFile)
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile=testFile)
}
trainRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```

#### Observation
1. Training Data set (19622 X 160)
2. Test Data Set (20 X 160)

### Clean the data
1. Clean the data
2. Get rid of observations with missing values 
3. Remover variables which does not contribute

```{r, cache = T}
sum(complete.cases(trainRaw))
```

Remove columns that contain NA missing values.

```{r, cache = T}
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
```  

Remove some columns that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.

```{r, cache = T}
classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```

#### Observation
1. Training Data set (19622 X 53)
2. Test Data Set (20 X 53)
3. The "classe" variable is still in the cleaned training set


### Slice the data
Then, we can split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We will use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in future steps.  
```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(22519) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]
```

## Data Modeling
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using **Random Forest** algorithm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general. We will use **5-fold cross validation** when applying the algorithm.  
```{r, cache = T}
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
```
Then, we estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.  
```{r, cache = T}
predictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)
confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)
```
```{r, cache = T}
accuracy <- postResample(predictRf, testData$classe)
accuracy
oose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)$overall[1])
oose
```
So, the estimated accuracy of the model is 99.42% and the estimated out-of-sample error is 0.58%.

## Predicting for Test Data Set
Now, we apply the model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the `problem_id` column first.  
```{r, cache = T}
result <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])
result
```  

## Appendix: Figures
1. Correlation Matrix Visualization  
```{r, cache = T}
corrPlot <- cor(trainData[, -length(names(trainData))])
corrplot(corrPlot, method="color")
```
2. Decision Tree Visualization
```{r, cache = T}
treeModel <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="class")
prp(treeModel) # fast plot
```
